# Wildfire and Air Quality Detection Application User Manual

## Overview

This application provides two main features:

1. **Wildfire Detection** - Displays the latest fire detection using satellite imagery.
2. **Air Quality Detection** - Displays the Air Quality Index (AQI) for various pollutants and provides real-time AQI updates.

The application is designed to track fire occurrences and monitor air quality, offering real-time insights and predictions to users.

## Features

### 1. **Wildfire Tab**: 
- **Description**: This tab shows the latest fire detection using satellite imagery. The AI model analyzes satellite images to detect fire incidents and provides real-time updates.
- **How to Use**:
  - Navigate to the **Wildfire Tab** in the app.
  - You will see the most recent fire detection events, including information such as fire location, timestamp, and detection confidence.

### 2. **Air Quality Tab**:
- **Description**: This tab shows the average Air Quality Index (AQI) for the country and provides insights into various air pollutants.
- **How to Use**:
  - Navigate to the **Air Quality Tab** in the app.
  - The **Average AQI** for the country will be displayed, providing a general view of air quality.
  - Additionally, specific AQI values for the following pollutants are shown:
    - **AQI_PM10**: Air Quality Index for PM10.
    - **AQI_PM25**: Air Quality Index for PM2.5.
    - **AQI_NO2**: Air Quality Index for NO2.
    - **AQI_O3**: Air Quality Index for O3.
    - **AQI_CO**: Air Quality Index for CO.
    - **AQI_Max**: Maximum AQI value observed.

### 3. **Location Tab**:
- **Description**: This tab shows your current location and the corresponding AQI for the area.
- **How to Use**:
  - Navigate to the **Location Tab** in the app.
  - Your current location is displayed on a map.
  - The app fetches the real-time AQI for your location and provides details on the air quality based on various pollutants.

## AQI Definitions

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a numerical scale used to represent the quality of air in a specific area. The app monitors the following pollutants:

- **PM10**: Particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less.
- **PM2.5**: Fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.
- **NO2**: Nitrogen Dioxide, a gas that can irritate the respiratory system.
- **CO**: Carbon Monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful at high concentrations.
- **O3**: Ozone, which can irritate the respiratory system.
- **AQI_Max**: The maximum AQI value for all monitored pollutants in the region.

## Application Workflow

1. **Wildfire Detection**:
   - The **satellite imagery detection** model is based on **YOLOv8 S**, which detects fire incidents in real-time using satellite images.
   - Once a fire is detected, the data is sent to a **MongoDB database**, and the mobile application fetches the most recent detection data for display.

2. **Air Quality Detection**:
   - Air quality data is fetched using real-time monitoring from various sensors.
   - The model for air quality prediction is trained using **TensorFlow**, based on the following inputs:
     - **PM25**, **PM10**, **Temperature**, **NO2**, **CO**, **O3**
   - The output provides AQI values for each pollutant and the maximum AQI observed.
